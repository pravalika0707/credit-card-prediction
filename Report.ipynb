    "\n",
    "The aim of this study is to exploit some supervised machine learning algorithms to identify the key drivers that determine the likelihood of credit card default, underlining the mathematical aspects behind the methods used. Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your credit card payments. In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, the overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and debts\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to build an automated model for both identifying the key factors, and predicting a credit card default based on the information about the client and historical transactions. The general concepts of the supervised machine learning paradigm are later reported, together with a detailed explanation of all techniques and algorithms used to build the models. In particular, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines algorithms have been applied.\n",

    "<a id='environment'></a>\n",
    "### 1.1 Environment\n",
    "The analysis has been fully conducted with Python language, exploiting several machine learning and statistical frameworks available such as `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `imblearn` together with other data visualization libraries (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some code snippets have been reported for a better understanding of each step. Moreover, the full code implementation of this analysis is publicly available at [github.com/robertofranceschi/default-credit-card-prediction](https://github.com/robertofranceschi/default-credit-card-prediction)."

    "Another relevant point which could affect the classification performances is the correlation among features: the presence of strongly correlated features may lead to a decline in the performances of some classification algorithms which assume that the predictors are all independent. Another benefit from spotting correlation among features is that the same information may be encoded with less attributes, and this could lead to simpler final models. Indeed, some methods suffer from high dimensional datasets (especially distance based ones with a few number of samples), so reducing the dimensions of the feature vectors can make it more trustable and stable, if the discarded dimensions don’t affect significantly the total original information.\n",

    "As already mentioned above, generally speaking it is not always a good idea to propagate in the algorithms all the samples attributes. The main reasons for which the dimensionality reduction is required are the following:\n",
    "- high dimensional data may negatively affect the algorithms perfomances (i.e. high computational costs);\n",
    "- high dimensionality might lead to poor generalization;\n",
    "- can be used for interpretability of the data (e.g. for illustraton purposes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover different machine learning algorithms suffer from the ***curse of dimensionality*** problem: if there are more features than observations the risk of massively overfitting the model becomes really high. Then, too many dimensions causes every observation in the dataset to appear equidistant from all the other, and this is effectively a problem when used distance-based algorithms (such as K-Nearest Neighbors), because if the distances are all approximately equal, then the observation appear equally alike (as well as equally different), making the algorithm perfomances meaningless.\n",

In this way, features with a Pearson coefficient $\\rho \\geqslant 0.92$ with other predictors should be discarded. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines maintain the same performance regardless the imbalancing techniques used, while this is not true for Random Forest, the reason might be that a decision tree to perform well needs lot of data but at the same time undersampling technique reduce the amount of data.\n",
    "- Overall, oversampling slightly outperforms undersampling;\n",
    "- The positive class is the most difficult to classify and none of the models chosen seems to be not able to get the complexity of the problem. \n",
    "- Empirically has been observed that in general undersampling require more time with respect to oversampling as preprocessing step, this is likely since the first one compute a k-means over all data to find centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the above mentioned algorithms have been tried out and hypertuned on the training set with a k-fold cross validation technique. The best performing configurations of hyperparameters on the training set have been chosen for rebuilding the models and evaluating them on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the table below the results of all the classifiers (in their best configuration) on validation and test set are compared. As we can see, the score obtained on the test set are pretty close to the one obtained in validation.\n",

    "## 6. Conclusions\n",
    "In this study different supervised learning algorithms have been inspected and presented with their mathematical details, and finally used on the UCI dataset to build a classification model that is able to predict if a credit card clients will default in the next month. Data preprocessing makes algorithms perform slightly better than when trained with original data: in particular, PCA results are approximately the same, but the computational cost has been lowered. Oversampling and undersampling techniques has been combined with PCA to assess the dataset imbalance problem. Oversampling as mentioned performed slightly better w.r.t. the undersampling, this is likely because the model is trained on a large amount of data. However, all the models implemented achieved comparable results in terms of accuracy."
